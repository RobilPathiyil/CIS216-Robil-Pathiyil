# CIS216-Robil-Pathiyil
I am taking this course because it is part of my major's coursework (cybersecurity) as it will help me strenthen my skills in programming and problem solving that is used in the field. For this course, I decided to use Python as my programming language because it is beginner-friendly, widely used in many fields like data science, web development, and cybersecurity, and has a simple syntax that makes it easier to learn and apply quickly. I intend to use Python not only for completing class assignments but also for building projects in cybersecurity, automation, and potentially even artificial intelligence applications.  
In session 2 I learned how to convert requirements into a concise, organized object-oriented module during this workshop. In order to maintain separation of concerns, I implemented input validation and error handling, developed a BMI calculator as a BMICalculator class with explicit public methods (metric/US) and private conversion helpers, and maintained all I/O in main.py. I used Google-style docstrings, consistent naming, type hints, and constants, as well as UML-to-code thinking (encapsulation, method design, and API clarity) in my adoption of PEP 8/PEP 257. My code is simpler to read, test, and expand thanks to these practices. In order to prepare for entry-level IT/cyber roles (such as help desk, SOC analyst, and junior automation) after I graduate from DePaul and enter the tech industry in 2026, I'll use this strategy throughout my coursework and as I develop a cybersecurity-focused portfolio. I'll automate small tools, write clean scripts, and document everything in Git.
