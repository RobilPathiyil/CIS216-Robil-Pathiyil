I am taking this course because it is part of my major's coursework (cybersecurity) as it will help me strenthen my skills in programming and problem solving that is used in the field. For this course, I decided to use Python as my programming language because it is beginner-friendly, widely used in many fields like data science, web development, and cybersecurity, and has a simple syntax that makes it easier to learn and apply quickly. I intend to use Python not only for completing class assignments but also for building projects in cybersecurity, automation, and potentially even artificial intelligence applications.
